- Maintain consistent error handling throughout
- Document all major decisions and assumptions
- Use type hints and docstrings consistently
- Follow git workflow for each prompt

## Expected Deliverables for Each Stage
1. Working code with tests
2. Documentation updates
3. Test coverage reports
4. Example outputs where applicable
5. Clean git history with meaningful commits

## Review Points
After each stage, verify:
1. Code quality and style
2. Test coverage
3. Documentation completeness
4. Error handling
5. Performance considerations
6. Git branch is clean and ready to merge
