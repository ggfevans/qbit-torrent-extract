# README Rewrite Plan

## Goal
Rewrite README.md to match the "no-BS, shit-talking" vibe of the refactoring session while remaining useful.

## Current State
- 79 lines, functional but dry
- Missing the personality (the *arr frustration, the BitBook jokes)
- Has sections that most users won't need (Config File details)

## Approach
Keep it short but add personality:
1. **Opening hook** - The "No files found" frustration that motivated this tool
2. **What it does** - One sentence, crystal clear
3. **Install** - pip, done
4. **qBittorrent setup** - The 3 steps, nothing more
5. **Formats** - Quick list
6. **Optional** - Brief mention of options for power users

## Target
~50-60 lines with more personality than the current version.

## Files to Modify
- `/Users/gvns/code/projects/qbit-torrent-extract/README.md`
